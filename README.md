<!--
**mercurial-fish/mercurial-fish** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting certification for Front End Development through Promineo Tech, as well as certification for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures through freecodecamp.com
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning loops and conditionals in JavaScript. Next stop: Arrays & Functions!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I read tarot, I know too much about TV/Movies, and I listen to showtunes A LOT! :japanese_ogre:
