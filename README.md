Hi there ðŸ‘‹



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting certification for Front End Development through Promineo Tech, as well as certification for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures through freecodecamp.com

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning loops and conditionals in JavaScript. Next stop: Arrays & Functions!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them

âš¡ Fun fact: I read tarot, I know too much about TV/Movies, and I listen to showtunes A LOT! :japanese_ogre:
